This repository contains the HTML, CSS and JavaScript of a simple and functional guess-number game.

The rules of the game are:
1. A random number between 1 and 20 is generated in every new game.
2. An input field is provided to input the guessed number.
3. Click on the 'Check!' button to check if that's the correct number.
4. If the number is too high or low, it will be displayed and if score is greater than 0, another opportunity is given to input another guessed number and check.
5. If the score is equals to 0, you've lost and have to tap on 'Again!' to play again.
6. If the guessed number is correct, the number will be displayed on the question mark box and it will be displayed that you won.
7. Every game has 20 chances or scores to try.
